This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Why the app?

This is a simple react budget calculator. The budget items have already been preset in the budget array. 

I built the app to learn more about separation of states in react and how to pass data from parent to child

## What the app does

When a budget item is clicked, the state of total is updated to match the cummulative total of the budget items. When clicked again, the state is updated to remove the item from total.

## Future thoughts

Once I get comfortable with redux/flux and storage of states, I will update the app so that the budget it has recurring budget items, the user generated budget items and user generated income. This way, it will act like a budget calculator.
